This project applies statistical inference and hypothesis testing techniques to the Palmer Penguins dataset to analyze biological differences among penguin species. The goal is to draw data-driven conclusions about relationships between physical characteristics such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass across different species and sexes.

Objectives:

1.Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and patterns

2.Formulate null and alternative hypotheses for biological comparisons

3.Apply appropriate statistical tests to validate or reject hypotheses

4.Interpret results using p-values 

5.Make statistically sound inferences about penguin species characteristics

Tools & Technologies:

1.Python

2.Pandas, NumPy

3.SciPy, StatsModels

4.Matplotlib, Seaborn

Dataset:

The dataset used is the Palmer Penguins dataset, a popular alternative to the Iris dataset for statistical learning and data analysis.
